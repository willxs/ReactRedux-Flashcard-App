# Structure of Project

## Components

These are components that can be reused throughout the project. If you feel like your component can be reused on multiple screens place them there. 

## Screens

The screen components always live in the **UI/Screens** folder. Inside a Screen component you will find

- `index.js` where the screen component itself lives
- various other components related to the screen component
